Hi Sakshi,

Thank you for contacting Kong Support.  Please find the Answers for the query below:

Query:

1: Question regarding how the time is calculated for RateLimit-Reset and Retry-After in both 'fixed' and 'sliding' window types.

Answer:

The calculations for RateLimit-Reset and Retry-After differ between 'fixed' and 'sliding' window types.
For a fixed window, the system monitors the remaining reset time and the reset limit. Once the request limit is exhausted, a 429 response is returned. At this point, RateLimit-Reset and Retry-After will indicate the time remaining until the next request is allowed.

For example, for the following configuration:

Limit size = 10

Window size = 60 seconds

With a fixed window strategy, it's easy to predict when the window is going to be reset and if the client sends a burst of traffic, 12 request per minute for example, it will have 10 requests accepted (response 200) and 2 rejected (response 429) per minute and so on. In general this is the expected response.




For sliding window types, the client sends a burst of 12 requests per minute, it will have the first 10 requests accepted (response 200) and all the following rejected (response 429).
The RateLimit-Reset & Retry-After will be calculated based on the algorithm and the reset time keeps on expanding.

2: I would also appreciate clarity on how requests are credited to consumers within a time frame in Kong Konnect.

The rate limiting for Fixed length will have a common reset/Retry window for all the consumers but for sliding window types, each will have different reset/Retry window




Below is example for:

Created 2 consumers: App & Bot

1: Fixed window strategy:

-> RateLimit-Reset and Retry-After will have common reset limit and once the limit is exhausted, both the App & Bot will get 429 response.

2: Sliding window types

-> Here consumers Bot and App have different RateLimit-Reset/Retry-After time, and the individual Reset/Retry time will be based on the internal algorithm.
